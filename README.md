# Java-Image-Manipulation-Program
an image manipulation program coded primarily in java

based off of stuff developed for a school assignment

writen using BlueJ

I'd like to add support for multiple layers, and some other functionality in the future

current limitation is that this is (currently) a one layer editor, meaning you can't have multiple layers like you can in gimp or many other editing softwares

## to use this
you need Java installed for this to work

either download the latest release 

or clone the repo, open your terminal, navigate to where you cloned it, and run `./gradlew run` if you want to be on the bleeding edge
