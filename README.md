# Java-Image-Manipulation-Program
an image manipulation program coded primarily in java

based off of stuff developed for a school assignment

writen using BlueJ

I'd like to add support for multiple layers, and some other functionality in the future

current limitation is that this is (currently) a one layer editor, meaning you can't have multiple layers like you can in gimp or many other editing softwares



the html documentation has been removed as it was causing this project to be falsely flagged as an html project lol

"Anthony Michael" is an allias btw
