# Java-Image-Manipulation-Program
an image manipulation program coded primarily in java

based off of stuff developed for a school assignment

writen using BlueJ

my goal is to have more functionality than MS paint 3d

and maybe around 1/2 of what GIMP can do

current limitation is that this is (currently) a one layer editor, meaning you can't have multiple layers like you can in gimp or many other editing softwares



the html documentation has been removed as it was causing this project to be falsely flagged as an html project lol
